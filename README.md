# Tutorial_Videos
This displays a small variety of videos I've made to provide additional support to my students and help solidify lesson concepts. They include simple tutorials in R, Python, and MySQL. The Heart Failure Dataset Analysis was actually my final project presentation when I was a student in the Data Science Program :) The videos are in vimeo and can also be viewed by placing the URL link  inside the notebook viewer at this website: https://nbviewer.org/ I hope you enjoy!
